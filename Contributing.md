### Important Points to remember while submitting your work üìç 

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

1. Use `PascalCase` for directory/folder names (e.g., `BrainTumorModel`, `DiabetesModel`).
2. Use `camelCase` for file names (e.g., `movieRecommendationModel`, `latestNews`, `ticTakToe`).
3. Name the main function exactly the same as the file name.
4. Limit commits to 3-4 unless given permission by project Admins or Mentors.
5. Keep commit messages clear and relevant; avoid unnecessary details.
6. **Never commit deployed model files to the repository; upload them to Google Drive, provide a downloadable link in the PR template, and update the `secrets.example.toml` file accordingly.**

### Pull Requests Review Criteria üß≤ 

1. Fill out the ***PR template*** properly when submitting a pull request.
2. Do not commit directly to the `main` branch, or your PR will be instantly rejected.
3. Ensure all work is original and not copied from other sources.
4. Add comments to your code wherever necessary for clarity.
5. Include a working video and show integration with Jarvis as part of your PR.
6. For frontend updates, share screenshots and work samples before submitting a PR.
